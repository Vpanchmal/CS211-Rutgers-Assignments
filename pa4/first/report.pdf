The main data structures I used in the assignment were queues and arrays. For one of the array data structure, it can be replaced with a hash table, but I didn't do that for my assignment. I used queues for the first in and first out policy because a queue does basically does that. I used arrays for cache because the size of an array is fixed and if there is one line in a set you could just use the array. Also if there are multiple lines then you can make a 2d array or a hashtable using that array. 

Some observation I made with prefetching is that I would get more hits then without prefetching because the prefetched blocks would take up space in the cache, which would casue a block to normally miss to hit because it was prefetched. In addition the number of misses reduced due to the more hits.
